/*
tectonic-license is a tool to manually create a tectonic license for use during
development. The tool allows you to verify an existing license using the -decode
flag, or to create a new license without the -decode flag. All uses require the
-key flag which should be the RSA public key when decoding/verifying and it should
be the RSA private key when generating a new license.
